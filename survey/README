In response to the "Inclusitivity Index" concept presented in the "Hack for Change, Nashville" event, the work in this notebook flows from the following use case scenario:

    * Survey forms are printed from the database for a specific survey, survey version, and location
    * Citizens fill out surveys
    * Survey responses are captured as text in a Survey Response Text File.
    * The Survey Response Text File is processed to add responses to the database
    * Charts and reports are produced
